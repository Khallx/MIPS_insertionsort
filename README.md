# MIPS_insertionsort

    # MIPS subset architecture CPU
    
    This VHDL implementation of MIPS seeks to implement a few of the architecture's instructions in order to run the InsertionSort algorithim.
    
    The current version implements:
    * add, 
    * addi, 
    * sw, 
    * lw, 
    * sll, 
    * slt, 
    * sltu, 
    * xor, 
    * lui, 
    * ori, 
    * beq, 
    * bne.     
 
    The MARS simulator is used to test the code and assemble it.
