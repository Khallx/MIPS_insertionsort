# MIPS_insertionsort

    This VHDL implementation of MIPS seeks to implement a few of the 
architecture's instructions in order to run the InsertionSort algorithim.
    The current version uses:
        add, addi, sw, lw, sll, slt, sltu, xor, lui, ori, beq, bne. 
    We use the MARS simulator to test the code and assemble it. 
    TO DO:
        -> Control path for the instructions
        -> Changes to the Data path to support all instructions
